Developed Smart Dustbin, an automated dry and wet waste segregator using Arduino, humidity sensors, and servo motors to enhance waste management efficiency. The system utilizes a humidity sensor to differentiate between dry and wet waste, triggering a servo mechanism to direct the waste into appropriate compartments. Programmed using Arduino IDE, the project integrates real-time waste detection, classification, and disposal automation. Designed to promote efficient recycling, reduce manual waste segregation, and enhance smart waste management in households and public places.
